# Problem Set 4: Classification with scikit-learn

In this repo, you'll find the following files:

* This README.
* The Jupyter notebook you will be modifying and turning in, `ps4_classification.ipynb`.
* A csv file of data called `features.csv`, which contains features from the `.wav` files you used for ps3.  
* A Jupyter notebook for your reference, `extract_features.ipynb`, which I used to extract the features in `features.csv`.

To run a Jupyter notebook, either launch Jupyter from Anaconda or launch a terminal, navigate to this directory, and type `jupyter notebook`.

Complete the Jupyter Notebook `ps4_classification.ipynb`, and commit and push it to the repo by 11:59pm Boston time, Monday September 28, 2020.
